This is a chatbot designed to help you create patches for the software synthesizer serum
this app runs on the open ai framework via streamlab, langchain, and the OpenAI framework
In order to engage this model, please provide specific descriptive terms of the sound you are looking for to the chatbot
The bot should then provide you a list of parameters to be put into your synthesizer
If the parameters generated are unhelpful, or the bot misses a parameter, re prompt it.
i.e.: " regenerate the previous information, but include relevant settings for the decay parameter
